2. ### Basic Components of Linux
	
	- **Kernel** - Interacts with hardware to run applications. Core component of Linux.

		- Debian itself acts as an upstream for Ubuntu and Ubuntu acts as an upstream for the subsequent OS.
		- Mainly used for Cloud Deployements.



## Doubts


Linux by itself is not an OS but is a Kernel and multiple softwares can be used with this kernel in various ways to create a wide range of OS' according to the need, thereby giving it it's infamous "Highly Customisable" tag. Is this statemtn true ?
